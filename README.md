# Economics
In this repository are stored all my simulations related to various topics regarding economics. 

In particular the focus is on monetary economics: the files stored here are mainly simulations regarding different monetary regimes. The aim is to compare the efficiency of different
monetary regimes in ensuring price, financial and general economic stability.
