# Economics
In this repository are stored all my simulations related to various topics regarding economics. 

In particular the focus is on monetary economics: the files stored here are mainly simulations regarding different monetary regimes. The aim is to compare the efficiency of different
monetary regimes in ensuring price, financial and general economic stability.

The monetary regimes I'd like to compare are the "traditional" interest rate targeting and the NGDP targeting.
